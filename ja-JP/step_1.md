Check:

+ **; expected**: check for a semicolon `;` at the end of each line of code.
+ **Newline in constant**: you missed a quote `"` from the end of a text string.
+ **} expected**: you should have a pair of open and closed curly brackets `{}` around each method and around the class. Check that your curly brackets match.
+ **) expected**: make sure there's a closing `)` at the end of each Method call, before the semicolon.
+ **Debug does not contain a definition for 'log'**: C# is case sensitive, it needs to be `Log` with a capital `L`.

**Tip:** Double-click on a code error in the Console to go straight to the line of code that is causing the problem.
